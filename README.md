<h1>yamato-koshi</h1>
    <p>A person who's interested in learning with people that like to show their abilities, so I can develop the various skills that such people can teach me.</p> 
    <p>I don't know everything, and I believe that all people in the world🌎 don't, so I believe wich learning with this new community
going to be the best decision for my <strong>programming adventure</strong>.</p>

   <p>Right know I'm learning web development, I already know a lot about the subject and am willing to learn even more.
After that, learn some programming languages like <ins>C</ins>, <ins>PYTHON</ins>, etc.</p>

<strong><em>I'm looking to collaborate in the IT world and make my best to improve the tech community.</em></strong>
